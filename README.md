# Scheduler
Scheduler for school. 

#WHAT?
Yep, the school now runs this. Bask in it's terribleness.

#Can I fix it
Sure. Make a pull request. Make sure it works perfectly, as remember the school uses this. It must be reliable

#How does it work?
Code.gs is all the actual code. Entry.html is just whats run when you open the main menu. All the other HTML is done in the javascript.
