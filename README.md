# Scheduler
Scheduler for school. 

#WHAT?
Yep, the school now runs this.

#Can I fix it
Sure. Make a pull request. Make sure it works perfectly, as remember the school uses this. It must be reliable

#How does it work?
Client.gs is what the learner gets. It calls Server.gs. Server.gs calls entry.html

#Can I add a feature that everyone will get?
If it's good enough, I will add it to main branch, and tell Mr. Bailey about it.
