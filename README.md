# Scheduler
Scheduler for school. 

#WHAT?
Yep, the school now runs this.

#Can I fix it
Sure. Make a pull request. Make sure it works perfectly, as remember the school uses this. It must be reliable.
*Master branch should always be ready to be pushed to live. If you want to test something, create a new branch+pull request*

#How does it work?
Client.gs is what the learner gets. It calls Server.gs remotely. Server.gs calls entry.html

#Can I add a feature that everyone will get?
If it's good enough, I will add it to main branch, and add it to the live.
